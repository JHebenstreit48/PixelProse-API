## History of C
---

The C programming language was developed in the early 1970s by **Dennis Ritchie** at **Bell Labs**. It was designed as an evolution of the B programming language, with improvements that made it better suited for system programming.

Initially, C was created to develop the **UNIX operating system**, and its success led to its widespread adoption in many areas of computing.

Key historical milestones in C’s development:

- **1972**: Dennis Ritchie designs C at Bell Labs.
- **1973**: UNIX operating system is rewritten in C.
- **1978**: Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie publish *The C Programming Language* (often referred to as **K&R C**).
- **1989**: ANSI standard for C is established — known as **ANSI C** or **C89**.
- **1990**: ISO standardizes C, leading to **C90**.
- **1999**: **C99** introduces new features like inline functions, new data types, and improved support for floating-point calculations.
- **2011**: **C11** standard adds features for multithreading and improved Unicode support.
- **2018**: **C17** standard provides minor bug fixes and clarifications.
- **Ongoing**: **C2X** (future revision) is under development for further improvements.

## Influence of C

C has had a profound impact on many modern programming languages, including:

- **C++** — originally developed as "C with Classes"
- **Objective-C** — used in Apple's ecosystem
- **Java**
- **C#**
- **Go**
- **Rust**

Even today, C remains a popular choice for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.

## Summary

The simplicity, efficiency, and portability of C have ensured its longevity. It has influenced nearly every modern programming language and continues to be a critical language in software development, especially in operating systems, embedded software, and high-performance computing.
