## Introduction to C#

<span class="emphasis">C#</span> (pronounced <span class="emphasis">"C-Sharp"</span>) is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by <span class="emphasis">Microsoft</span> as part of its <span class="emphasis">.NET</span> platform. It is designed to be both powerful and developer-friendly, supporting a wide range of application types that run on the <span class="emphasis">.NET Framework</span> and <span class="emphasis">.NET Core</span> (now unified under <span class="emphasis">.NET</span>).

C# is widely used to build everything from console applications and web services to video games and enterprise systems.

## Why Use C#?

- <span class="emphasis">C#</span> provides a clear and consistent structure for programs, enabling maintainable and reusable code.
- It supports modern programming features like asynchronous programming, pattern matching, and strong type safety.
- It is versatile and used to create:
  <span class="bullet1">
  - Mobile applications  
  - Desktop applications  
  - Web applications and services  
  - Websites  
  - Games  
  - VR applications  
  - Cloud-native and database applications  
  </span>

## Program Execution

Every C# application must include a <span class="emphasis">Main</span> method. This method serves as the **entry point** of the program—when the application is started, execution begins with <span class="inline-code">Main()</span>.

Think of the <span class="inline-code">Main</span> method as the **front door** to your application. It’s the starting location where your logic begins running, and it's required even for simple console programs.

Example:

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

## Summary

C# is a robust and modern programming language. With a balance of simplicity, scalability, and performance, it is an excellent choice for building cross-platform software—from beginner console projects to professional-grade systems in gaming, finance, and beyond.
