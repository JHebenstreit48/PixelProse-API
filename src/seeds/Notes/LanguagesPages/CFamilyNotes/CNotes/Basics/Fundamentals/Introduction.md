## What is the C Language?

---

C is a general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for over 50 years. It is extremely powerful and provides low-level memory access and efficient performance. Because of its simplicity and control, C has been the foundation for many modern programming languages.

C is commonly used in:

- Operating system development (e.g., UNIX, Linux, Windows)
- Database systems
- Embedded systems
- System-level programming
- High-performance applications

The language offers fine control over hardware and memory, making it ideal for system programming tasks where performance and efficiency are critical.

## Key Features of C

- Portability across platforms
- Low-level memory manipulation (pointers)
- Efficient use of system resources
- Structured programming support
- Rich library of built-in functions
- Foundation for modern languages like C++, Java, and C#

## A Simple "Hello, World!" Program

Below is an example of a basic C program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Hello, World!
```

## Summary

C remains one of the most influential and widely used programming languages in the world. It forms the basis for understanding more complex languages and continues to be a standard choice for systems programming, embedded development, and performance-critical applications.
