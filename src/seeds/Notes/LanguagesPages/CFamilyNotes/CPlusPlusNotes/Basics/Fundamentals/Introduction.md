## Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful, cross-platform programming language used to create high-performance applications. It is widely used in systems programming, game development, real-time simulations, and applications where performance and memory management are critical.

Originally developed as an extension of the C programming language, C++ was created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** in 1979 at Bell Labs. It introduced object-oriented programming features to C and has continued to evolve over the decades.

Modern C++ supports multiple programming paradigms, including:

- Procedural programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Generic programming
- Functional programming

This flexibility, combined with fine-grained control over system resources, makes C++ a popular choice for performance-critical software.

## Key Features of C++

- Cross-platform compatibility
- High performance and efficiency
- Object-oriented features like classes, inheritance, and polymorphism
- Extensive Standard Template Library (STL)
- Low-level memory manipulation
- Wide industry use in finance, embedded systems, gaming, and more

## A Simple "Hello, World!" Program

Hereâ€™s an example of a basic C++ program that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Hello, World!
```

## Summary

C++ remains one of the most influential programming languages, combining the efficiency and control of low-level programming with the power and abstraction of high-level programming paradigms. Understanding C++ is an excellent foundation for any software developer interested in systems-level or performance-critical development.
