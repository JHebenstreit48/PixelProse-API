## What is the C Language?

---

C is a general-purpose programming language that has been widely used for over 50 years. It is extremely powerful and provides low-level memory access and efficient performance. Because of its simplicity and control, C has been the foundation for many modern programming languages.

C is commonly used in:

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Operating system development (e.g., UNIX, Linux, Windows)</span>  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Database systems</span>  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">Embedded systems</span>  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">System-level programming</span>  
ðŸ”¹ <span class="emphasis">High-performance applications</span>  

</div>

The language offers fine control over hardware and memory, making it ideal for system programming tasks where performance and efficiency are critical.

## A Simple "Hello, World!" Program

Below is an example of a basic C program that prints "Hello World" to the console.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Output

```shell
Hello, World!
```
